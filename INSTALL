Debian / Ubuntu
===============

Pre-build
---------
You need a C compiler, the build system SCons and a list of other libraries. Some of them can be downloaded using apt-get or aptitude.

sudo apt-get install build-essential scons libconfig8-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgsl0-dev libxml2-dev libargtable2-dev

You must compile the following dependencies: cprops

cprops can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cprops/
During the configuration phase, use the following command:

./configure --disable-cpsp --disable-cpsvc

Then 'make' and, if you want to install it in your system, 'sudo make install' (by default it will be installed in /usr/local/lib)

Set the path to the cprops library you installed manually so that SCons can find it during the build. Library paths are read from the 'buildaux.conf' file. 
You only need to set the fields: CPROPS_INCLUDE_PATH, CPROPS_LIBRARY_PATH (don't forget the quotes around them)

Build
-----
From the root folder of the application, type 'scons'.



Fedora
======

Pre-build
---------
You need a C compiler, the build system SCons and a list of other libraries. Some of them can be downloaded using yum.

sudo yum install gcc-c++ glibc-devel scons libconfig-devel libcurl-devel gsl-devel libxml2-devel libcprops-devel

You must compile the following dependencies: argtable-2.x

Argtable can be downloaded from http://argtable.sourceforge.net/ (make sure you pick up the 2.x version!)
In order to construct the static (.a) library file, run 'cmake && make'. Don't run ./configure or it will generate a .la file.

Set the path to the argtable library you installed manually so that SCons can find it during the build. Library paths are read from the 'buildaux.conf' file. 
You only need to set the fields: ARGTABLE_INCLUDE_PATH, ARGTABLE_LIBRARY_PATH (don't forget the quotes around them)
