Debian / Ubuntu
===============

Pre-build
---------
You need a C compiler, the build system SCons and a list of other libraries. Some of them can be downloaded using apt-get or aptitude.

sudo apt-get install build-essential scons libconfig8-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgsl0-dev libxml2-dev libargtable2-dev

You must compile the following dependencies: cprops

cprops can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cprops/
During the configuration phase, use the following command:

./configure --disable-cpsp --disable-cpsvc --with-cflags=-O2 --prefix=/path/to/install/dir

** By default, prefix = /usr/local

Now it is neccessary to modify a bit the auto-generated Makefile. In the first section, path variables such as 'prefix', 'bindir', 'libdir', etc., should be defined. XXXdir ones don't point to correct paths. You must replace this:

bindir = $(DESTDIR)${exec_prefix}/bin
libdir = $(DESTDIR)${exec_prefix}/lib
incdir = $(DESTDIR)${prefix}/include/cprops
mandir = $(DESTDIR)${datarootdir}/man
datadir = ${prefix}/share
man3dir = $(mandir)/man3

With this:

bindir = ${prefix}/bin
libdir = ${prefix}/lib
incdir = ${prefix}/include/cprops
mandir = ${prefix}/man
datadir = ${prefix}/share
man3dir = ${prefix}/man3

Then type 'make && make install'.

Set the path to the cprops library so that SCons can find it during the build. Library paths are read from the 'buildvars.py' file. 
You need to set the fields: CPROPS_INCLUDE_PATH, CPROPS_LIBRARY_PATH (don't forget the quotes around them) in the root folder of HPG Variant, in libs/common-libs, and in libs/bioinfo-libs.

Build
-----
From the root folder of the application, type 'scons'.



Fedora
======

Pre-build
---------
You need a C compiler, the build system SCons and a list of other libraries. Some of them can be downloaded using yum.

sudo yum install gcc-c++ glibc-devel scons libconfig-devel libcurl-devel gsl-devel libxml2-devel libcprops-devel

You must compile the following dependencies: argtable-2.x

Argtable can be downloaded from http://argtable.sourceforge.net/ (make sure you pick up the 2.x version!)
Run the following:

./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir && make && make install

** By default, prefix = /usr

Set the path to the argtable library so that SCons can find it during the build. Library paths are read from the 'buildvasr.py' file. 
You need to set the fields: ARGTABLE_INCLUDE_PATH, ARGTABLE_LIBRARY_PATH (don't forget the quotes around them) in the root folder of HPG Variant.

Build
-----
From the root folder of the application, type 'scons'.
